# Paths the app looks in for certain files as well as starting paths for opening and saving files.
# Acts like PATH variable in UNIX systems. Add comma separated list of paths kMap should search when loading files.

# To change paths for the log files please edit "logging_user.ini" file
# To let the system handle the paths (remembering in-session used paths) write None (does not work for system files)

[lmfit]
# Settings for the LMFit process.
# Tolerance for the reduced chi^2 value in the LMFit process. Only has
# an effect for the 'leastsq' and 'least_squares' methods.

# If the user enters an initial value at or below its minimum value
# it will be set to: minimum + padding. Only applies if vary is True

[cube]
# Settings regarding the .cube data format.
# The first two lines in .cube files should contain information about the origin of and a shortname for the data set. Set order here.

[orbital]
# Settings regarding the calculation/simulation of orbitals.
# Sets the 3D resolution in k-space. Tweak carefully, low values can have a big performance impact.
dk3D=0.12
# Sets the default resolution for kmaps calculated. If interpolation is used, this is not the same resolution as displayed but it still impacts the image as it is the resolution from which the kmap gets interpolated from. (Exception: In the LMFit process the kmap from orbitals are not interpolated but actually calculated by overriding this value to significantly speed up performance).  
dk=0.03
# Maximum allowed kinetic energy.
E_kin_max=150
# Kinetic energies that will be exported. Can be either a list with concrete values (e.g. [1,2,3]) or
# a dictionary with the keys: 'max', 'min', 'num'. In any case it has to result in at least 2 slices
# to be again loadable by kMap as SlicedData.

# Matching the 'average', 'max', 'min' or 'current' energy level of first SlicedDataTab found.
