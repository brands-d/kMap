# settings_default.ini
# Settings file for all things not passed to the logging module or shortcuts.
# DO NOT edit settings here. Copy the settings into the *_user file and edit there.

# App
[app]
# App-related settings. None of these settings can not be changed a runtime.
# Dark Theme (not particularly recommend as it messes with the layout a
# bit. If high demand I will try to fix the layout issues.)

# None of these settings can not be changed at runtime.

[paths]
# Paths the app looks in for certain files as well as starting paths for opening and saving files.
# Starting path for loading .cube files (OrbitalDataTabs)
cube_start=.
# Starting path for loading .hdf5 files (SlicedDataTabs)
hdf5_start=.
# Path the app looks for the database file.
database=resources/misc/molecules.txt
# Path the app looks for the colormap file.

# Path for saving project files

# Path for the background equations

txt_export_start=.
# Standard Path Matplotlib images are saved to
matplotlib=None
# To change paths for the log files please edit "logging_user.ini" file
# To let the system handle the paths (remembering in-session used paths) write None (does not work for system files)

[logging]
# Meta-settings for the logging process, which are not being parseable to the logging module.
# Sets whether the logging file is cleared at program startup. Set True to append to a existing logging file instead of deleting it.
persistent=False

[lmfit]
# Settings for the LMFit process.
# Tolerance for the reduced chi^2 value in the LMFit process. Only has
# an effect for the 'leastsq' and 'least_squares' methods.
xtol=1e-11
# LMFit has problems when an initial value starts at its lower boundary.
# If the user enters an initial value at or below its minimum value
# it will be set to: minimum + padding. Only applies if vary is True
padding=1e-5

; Data
[cube]
# Settings regarding the .cube data format.
# The first two lines in .cube files should contain information about the origin of and a shortname for the data set. Set order here.

[orbital]
# Settings regarding the calculation/simulation of orbitals.
# Sets the 3D resolution in k-space. Tweak carefully, low values can have a big performance impact.
dk3D=0.12
# Sets the default resolution for kmaps calculated. If interpolation is used, this is not the same resolution as displayed but it still impacts the image as it is the resolution from which the kmap gets interpolated from. (Exception: In the LMFit process the kmap from orbitals are not interpolated but actually calculated by overriding this value to significantly speed up performance).  
dk=0.03
# Maximum allowed kinetic energy.
E_kin_max=150
# Kinetic energies that will be exported. Can be either a list with concrete values (e.g. [1,2,3]) or
# a dictionary with the keys: 'max', 'min', 'num'. In any case it has to result in at least 2 slices
# to be again loadable by kMap as SlicedData.
export_energies={'max': 35, 'min': 25, 'num': 10}
# Matching the 'average', 'max', 'min' or 'current' energy level of first SlicedDataTab found.
match_type=average
# Default share of s-polarized light for the case of unpolarized light (between 0 and 1)

[matplotlib]
# Settings regarding the display of images in the MatPlotLib window.
# MatPlotLib displays matrix data with coordinates corresponding to the upper left corner of the "pixel". This settings shifts data to have the coordinates correspond to the center of pixel.
pixel_center=True
# Sets the ratio for matplotlib windows that display images (not for line plots). Set "None" to force no ratio.

[crosshair]
# Settings regarding the crosshair.
# Whether the labels in the crosshair block display the average intensity per non-nan "pixel" or the summed up intensity.
